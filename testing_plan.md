# Testing Plan â€“ CampusSafe

## Objective
To ensure CampusSafe is accurate, ethical, and effective in real-world threat detection.

## Testing Components

### 1. Computer Vision Testing
- **Test data:** Simulated security footage with staged actions
- **Metrics:** Object detection accuracy, false positives/negatives
- **Goal:** 95%+ accuracy in detecting weapons, fire, or fighting

### 2. NLP Testing
- **Test data:** Curated tweets/posts with threatening and neutral language
- **Metrics:** Sentiment analysis precision, keyword flagging, context detection
- **Goal:** Flag 90% of real threats, avoid mislabeling normal posts

### 3. Alert System
- Test how fast alerts are generated and delivered
- Simulate real emergency scenarios

### 4. Ethical Testing
- Review by ethics board or simulated review group
- Feedback loop for students/staff on privacy

## Simulation
Before live use, run the system on recorded data to evaluate outcomes without putting real people at risk.

## Final Success Criteria
- Accurate threat detection with minimal false alarms
- High-speed alerts with clear information
- Positive feedback from ethics testers
