# Project Proposal – CampusSafe

## Project Overview
CampusSafe is an AI-based safety system designed to monitor and detect threats on school and university campuses using real-time video and social media analysis. The goal is to provide early warning alerts to prevent dangerous incidents before they escalate.

## Problem Being Solved
Many campuses lack real-time systems to detect potential threats. Emergencies like shootings, fires, or fights often go unreported until it’s too late. Students may post warning signs online that are missed. CampusSafe solves this by combining surveillance with AI-powered monitoring to help keep students and staff safe.

## Why AI is Needed
- **Computer Vision (CV):** Detect weapons, fire, or erratic behavior from security camera feeds.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Scan public social media posts to flag threatening language or intentions.
- **Automated Alerts:** Reduce delay between threat detection and emergency response.

## Key Goals
- Early detection of threats
- Fast, accurate alerting to security personnel
- High privacy standards and ethical boundaries

## Audience
The system is designed for:
- Campus security departments
- University administration
- Students and staff indirectly benefit from improved safety
