## Project Title
Smart Mental Health Support Chatbot 

## Project Description
This project proposes the design of an AI-powered mental health chatbot capable of providing supportive conversation, recognizing signs of distress, and suggesting resources to users in need. The system emphasizes ethical design, user privacy, and accessibility.

## How to Read This Documentation
The project is organized as follows:
- `proposal.md` – high-level overview of the problem and proposed solution
- `solution_plan.md` – technical design, system architecture, features
- `testing_plan.md` – how the system would be tested for accuracy, safety, and performance
- `slides.pdf` – presentation version of the project for submission

I have written clearly with diagrams and examples for easy understanding.
